# Robijn Fotografie Portfolio

Beau Robijnâ€™s photography portfolio and booking site, built with SvelteKit. The app highlights editorial work, supports simple lead capture, and ships with an admin console for managing copy and assets without redeploying.

## Features
- Home, About, Portfolio, and Contact pages driven by structured content (`app/content.json`).
- Protected admin dashboard (`/admin`) with live editing and image uploads stored under `CONTENT_DIR/uploads`.
- Nodemailer-powered contact form with configurable SMTP credentials.
- XML sitemap (`/sitemap.xml`), tuned `robots.txt`, and canonical meta tags for basic SEO.
- Docker multi-stage build for production and `docker-compose.yml` for local container runs.

## Tech Stack
- SvelteKit 2 + Vite 7, Svelte 5 runes API, Tailwind CSS 4 utilities.
- Node 20 runtime (both dev and Docker image).
- Playwright (e2e) and Vitest (unit) included but optional.
- Nodemailer for transactional email delivery.

## Getting Started
```bash
npm install          # installs root and app dependencies
npm run dev          # launches the SvelteKit dev server on http://localhost:5173
```
Use `npm run build` for a production build and `npm run preview` to inspect the output locally.

### Environment Variables
Copy `app/.env.example` (if present) or create `app/.env` with:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Password for `/admin` login (default: `robijnstudio`). |
| `CONTENT_DIR` / `CONTENT_FILE` | Optional custom storage path/file for content JSON and uploads. |
| `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_SECURE`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD` | Nodemailer transport configuration. |
| `EMAIL_FROM`, `EMAIL_TO` | Override mail sender and recipient addresses. |
| `PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (preferred) or `SITE_URL` / `BASE_URL` | Sets canonical URLs and sitemap origin. |

After configuring SMTP values, submit the contact form to verify mail delivery.

## Admin Console
1. Visit `/admin`.
2. Log in with the configured password.
3. Adjust copy, add portfolio entries, or upload media. Changes persist to `content.json` (or the overridden path).

Uploads are saved under `<CONTENT_DIR>/uploads` and exposed publicly via `/uploads/<filename>`, so avoid storing sensitive files there.

## SEO & Meta
- `app/static/robots.txt` blocks `/admin` and lists the sitemap.
- `/sitemap.xml` is generated server-side and cached for one hour.
- The root layout inserts canonical links, Open Graph defaults, a Twitter card, and theme color metadata.

## Testing
- `npm run check` for TypeScript + Svelte diagnostics.
- `npm run test:unit` for Vitest suites.
- `npm run test:e2e` to execute Playwright tests (requires browsers installed via `npx playwright install`).

## Deployment
- Production image `Dockerfile` builds SvelteKit, installs production dependencies, and runs `node build`.
- `docker-compose.yml` maps port `3013 -> 3000` locally and mounts a volume (`content-data`) so content and uploads survive container restarts.
- Ensure environment variables (especially SMTP and `PUBLIC_SITE_URL`) are provided in your hosting platform or Docker compose file.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. Please run `npm run check` before submitting changes and keep the content schema (`app/src/lib/types/content.ts`) in sync with any new fields exposed in the UI.
